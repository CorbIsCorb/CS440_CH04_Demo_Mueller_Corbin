# CS440_CH04_Demo_Mueller_Corbin

I chose a MIT license to allow for my code to be easily reused and distributed. Anybody is allowed to use my code and modify it however they'd like, as long as I receive attribution for my contribution and am also not held liable for their changes. Because of its flexibility, the MIT license has become a very popular software license.
